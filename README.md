## Paper resumes are obsolete
Computer scientists of all people should be moving on from paper resumes. Gone are the days of printing stacks of resumes to hand out to potential employers.

## Why markdown? 
This resume is a markdown file that is rendered into a webpage. This allows me to update my resume and track changes using Github. I can also easily share a link to my resume with anyone.
